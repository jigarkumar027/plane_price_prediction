# plane_price_prediction

Plane Price Prediction is a Kaggle competition so any one can download the dataset from there.

Here I approach this Project From DataSet--->EDA--->Feature Engineering--->Feature Selection--->ML model-->Interpretation--->deployment.

The Technologies that I have Used Are  Python,Matplotlib, Machine Learning,Heroku and other Data Preprocessing Libraries..

The Basic Data Science Project Life Cycle include :
  1. Gathering Data
  2. Understanding The Dataset ( EDA )
  2. Feature Engineering ( Data Cleaning )
  3. Feature Scaling ( depend Upon The ML Algo. that We Use and the Type Of data That We have )
  4. Feature Selection
  5. Model Creation 
  6. Evaluation The Model
  7. Deployment
  
I have Done The Deployment in Heroku Platform.
